# OSCAR-OMSCS

Hides all non-OMSCS classes in OSCAR Advanced Course Lookup interface.

## Installation

In the future, you should be able to install directly via the Firefox extension interface.

For now, you can use this extension by [loading it locally](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/). For now, you can clone this repository, navigate to `about:debugging` in Firefox, click "This Firefox" on the left, select "Load Temporary Add-on", and navigate to the repo, selecting any file within the extension directory. You should then see an ugly yellow "O" icon on your browser toolbar.

## Instructions

Within the OSCAR interface, click on "Look Up Classes" and then click on "Advanced Search". Select all subjects (departments) of interest - for OMSCS students, this would be, at most, "Computational Science & Engr", "Computer Science", "Industrial & Systems Engr", and "Public Policy". Click the "Section Search" button (no need to select "Online" for Campus). You should arrive at this page:

Clicking the "O" icon in your Firefox toolbar will hide that gigantic image and all non-OMSCS classes, but should not otherwise impact the function of this interface.
